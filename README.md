# OpenGSA Authentication web app

<!--TODO add event description-->

A Walla Walla University alumni currently working at Google helped the Computer Science Club host a hackathon where we built a web application using [Remix](https://remix.run/) and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) to display data from the [OpenGSA API](https://tailwindcss.com/), an API for authenticating legitimate social media accounts of government organizations.


To run the app locally, clone the this repository into your local machine

```{bash}
git clone https://github.com/SamuelSHernandez/google_hackathon_app.git
```

Now, build the app.

```{bash}
npm run dev
```
