# OpenGSA Authentication web app

<!--TODO add event description-->

A Walla Walla University alumni currently working at Google helped the Computer Science Club host a hackathon where we built a web application using Remix and Tailwind to display data from the OpenGSA API, an API for authenticating legitimate social media accounts of government organizations.


To run the app locally, clone the this repository into your local machine

```{bash}
git clone https://github.com/SamuelSHernandez/google_hackathon_app.git
```

Now, build the app.

```{bash}
npm run dev
```
